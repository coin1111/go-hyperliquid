  - Market data (L2 order book, trades, candles)
  - Trading operations (orders, positions, leverage)
  - User account management
  - Wallet operations
- Both mainnet and testnet environments
- Proper error handling and type safety
- Built-in reconnection and recovery mechanisms
- Concurrent-safe operations

## Usage

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "log"
    
    "github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/crypto"
    hyperliquid "github.com/coin1111/go-hyperliquid"
)

func main() {
    // Initialize client
    client := hyperliquid.NewClient(hyperliquid.MainnetAPIURL)
    
    // For trading, create an Exchange with your private key
    privateKey, _ := crypto.HexToECDSA("your-private-key")
    exchange := hyperliquid.NewExchange(
        privateKey,
        hyperliquid.MainnetAPIURL,
        nil,    // Meta will be fetched automatically
        "vault-address",
        "account-address",
        nil,    // SpotMeta will be fetched automatically
    )
    
    // Place a limit order
    order := hyperliquid.OrderRequest{
        Coin:    "BTC",
        IsBuy:   true,
        Size:    0.1,
        LimitPx: 40000.0,
        OrderType: hyperliquid.OrderType{
            Limit: &hyperliquid.LimitOrderType{
                Tif: "Gtc",
            },
        },
    }
    
    resp, err := exchange.Order(order, nil)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    
    // Subscribe to WebSocket updates
    ws := hyperliquid.NewWebsocketClient(hyperliquid.MainnetAPIURL)
    if err := ws.Connect(context.Background()); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    defer ws.Close()
    
    // Subscribe to BTC trades
    _, err = ws.Subscribe(hyperliquid.Subscription{
        Type: "trades",
        Coin: "BTC",
    }, func(msg hyperliquid.WSMessage) {
        fmt.Printf("Trade: %+v\n", msg)
    })
}
```
